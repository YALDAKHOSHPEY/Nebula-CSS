# 🧩 CSS Art – Futuristic Resources Page (No JS)

_This is a submission for the [Frontend Challenge: Office Edition sponsored by Axero, CSS Art: Office Culture](https://dev.to/challenges/frontend/axero)._

## ✨ Inspiration

This CSS Art project features a **futuristic Resources page** built completely with **HTML and CSS**, with **no JavaScript** involved.

The layout simulates an intranet panel inside a sci-fi office, with glowing buttons, soft hover effects, and a cosmic UI feeling.

> Created by **ME** as part of Task 2, this was designed to pair visually with the larger **NebulaWorks Admin Dashboard** developed by my twin sister, [Vida Khoshpey](https://github.com/VIDAKHOSHPEY22).

## 🚀 Journey

This project challenged me to focus purely on styling, layout, and interactivity using only CSS. I took inspiration from galactic themes and modern admin UIs.

I also learned how to make a complete experience feel interactive without scripting — focusing instead on micro-interactions and visual flow.
